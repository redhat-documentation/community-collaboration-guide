==== Synchronization Methods

The following synchronization methods are currently recommended:

* <<ccg-create-repo-synch-batchcommit,Batch Commit>>


[[ccg-create-repo-synch-batchcommit]]
==== Batch Commit Synchronization Method

[[ccg-create-repo-synch-batchcommit-when]]
===== When to Use this Approach

The batch commit process is a good approach to use when you need to incorporate upstream content into product documentation and the product contains a good deal of additional product-specific content.
In other words, when the upstream content is included as a _subset_ of the product documentation.

[[ccg-create-repo-synch-batchcommit-prereq]]
===== Prerequisites

The batch commit method assumes that your upstream repository is hosted on GitHub and the machine where you run the batch commit script has the following utilities installed:

* `curl`
* `zip`

[[ccg-create-repo-synch-batchcommit-dir]]
===== Directory Structure

The batch commit example described here assumes that you have a book directory, `my-sample-book`, structured as follows:

----
my-sample-book/
|__ fetch-upstream.sh
|__ docinfo.xml
|__ master.adoc
|__ topics/
|__ upstream/
----

Where `fetch-upstream.sh` is the batch commit script (for details, see <<ccg-create-repo-synch-batchcommit-script>>), and `upstream` is a subdirectory reserved for the upstream content.

[[ccg-create-repo-synch-batchcommit-workflow]]
===== Workflow

Given that you already have a batch commit script, `fetch-upstream.sh`, the workflow for synchronizing content from the upstream repository is as follows:

. Pull down the latest content from the upstream repository and put the downloaded files in the `upstream/` subdirectory:
+
----
$ ./fetch-upstream.sh
----

. Inspect the downloaded content (for example, using `git diff`) to check for new files, restructured content, and so on.
If necessary, edit the book file, `master.adoc`, to incorporate new content.

. Add and commit the downloaded content:
+
----
$ git add upstream
$ git commit -m "Synched content from upstream"
----

[[ccg-create-repo-synch-batchcommit-script]]
===== Sample Batch Commit Script

The batch commit script, `fetch-upstream.sh`, is a simple `bash` script that pulls down the latest upstream content, copying the relevant upstream files into the `upstream` subdirectory.
The script exploits a particular feature of GitHub, whereby GitHub provides a downloadable archive file containing the working tree for any branch in the repository.
The archive file has a snapshot of the _latest_ content in a particular branch and thus provides an ideal basis for synchronizing content downstream.

To see how his works, consider the following sample `fetch-upstream.sh` script developed for synchronizing the contents of the _Apache Camel Component Reference_:

----
#!/bin/sh

branch=camel-2.18.x <1>

echo "info: fetching upstream content from branch: $branch"
echo

# -L = follow redirects
curl -L -o $branch.zip https://github.com/apache/camel/archive/$branch.zip <2>

# -o = overwrite, -j = flatten directory structure, -q = quiet
unzip -qjo -d upstream $branch.zip camel-$branch/components/camel-*/src/main/docs/*.adoc <3>
unzip -qjo -d upstream/images $branch.zip camel-$branch/components/camel-*/src/main/docs/*.png
unzip -qjo -d upstream $branch.zip camel-$branch/camel-core/src/main/docs/*-component.adoc

rm $branch.zip <4>
----

<1> Set the `branch` variable to the name of the upstream branch.
<2> Download the archive (`.zip`) file from GitHub, which includes a snapshot of the latest content from the `$branch` branch and store it locally as the file, `$branch.zip`.
<3> Extract the relevant documentation files from the archive and put them into the `upstream` subdirectory.
Note that the `unzip` command is a remarkably flexible tool for extracting content from the archive.
In this particular case, the AsciiDoc files are embedded in the Java code base and scattered across hundreds of subdirectories.
But thanks to the globbing capabilities of `unzip`, it takes only a few commands to find and extract all the relevant files.
<4> Clean up, by removing the downloaded archive, `$branch.zip`.

NOTE: It is not necessary for the script to figure out whether specific files have changed or not.
Git automatically detects when a file has changed based on the file's content, not its creation time.
So Git ignores any files with the same content as before.

===== Pros and Cons

Given the simplicity of the batch commit script, you might get the impression that it is not as powerful as other approaches.
But if you compare it with a mechanism that provides similar functionality -- for example, Git _submodules_ -- it measures up well.
For example, <<table-batch-commit-git-submodule>> makes a point by point comparison of the batch commit process against the Git submodule process.
