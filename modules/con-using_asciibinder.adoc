= Using AsciiBinder

In addition to providing a system to structure and maintain documentation for multiple brands using a single repository, AsciiBinder also provides the ability to preview and package documentation as a set of HTML files that you can publish on a website.

Run the following command to build a preview of the documentation:

[options="nowrap" subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
$ asciibinder build
----

The output of this command is saved in the `<docs_repo_dir>/_preview/<distro>/<branch_dir_name>` directory.

Run the following command to package the documentation:

[options="nowrap" subs="verbatim,quotes"]
----
$ asciibinder package
----

The output of this command is saved in the `<docs_repo_dir>/_package/<distro>/<branch_dir_name>` directory. Each sub-directory in the `_package` represents the website content for a single brand, and can be copied to a hosting server as is.
