= AsciiBinder

AsciiBinder is a Ruby-based command-line tool that is designed to streamline the documentation and publication process for teams that manage a large volume of content and re-publish that content regularly. AsciiBinder allows you to share content across multiple distributions by using a map of content that is common to all distributions and by breaking the metadata for each distribution out into a separate branch in Git.
