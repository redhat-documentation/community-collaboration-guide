[[ccg-asciibinder-tool]]
=== AsciiBinder

AsciiBinder is a Ruby-based command-line tool that is designed to streamline the documentation and publication process for teams that manage a large volume of content and re-publish that content regularly. AsciiBinder allows you to share content across multiple distributions by using a map of content that is common to all distributions and by breaking the metadata for each distribution out into a separate branch in Git.

Advantages::
* Stable
* Simple to use
* Low barrier to entry

Challenges::
* Support is provided on an ad-hoc basis
* Uses a fixed directory structure defined by AsciiBinder

[[ccg-gitbook-tool]]
=== GitBook

GitBook is a documentation hosting system based on GitHub.

Website: link:https://www.gitbook.com[https://www.gitbook.com^]

Advantages::
* Very low barrier to entry for community members
** Easy to make edits
** Comes with a built-in stylesheet
* Publishes in AsciiDoc
* Integrates into GitHub
* Allows inline comments
* Supports building books written in multiple languages
** Each language is in a subdirectory
** Support for rtl languages
* Includes a full-text search engine
** JSON index file on a static version of the documentation

Challenges::
* Having to review inline comments is time consuming when you are also monitoring issue tracking systems
* Converting to downstream requires a Python script
* Requires a lengthy process to pull content from GitBook to the downstream
* Directory tree defined by GitBook and does not allow for easy manipulation
* Only free for a small number of managers, has a cost after that
* Things that work in AsciiDoc do not always work in GitBook
** Certain special tags will completely break things in GitBook
** AsciiDoc is not fully supported in GitBook
* GitBook requires that we use a JSON file for attributes which is not as flexible as AsciiDoc
** You can embed attributes in AsciiDoc, but not in JSON
* GitBook support is ad-hoc
* Edits are immediately committed
* Editor is not advanced enough to keep in conditional tags in place

[[ccg-rst-sphinx-tool]]
=== RST with Sphinx

http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html[reStructuredText (RST)] is a popular lightweight documentation format used by many, particularly Python-based, projects and open source communities. RST is often used alongside the http://www.sphinx-doc.org/[Sphinx documentation generator], which can be seen as an counterpart of the AsciiDoctor toolchain for AsciiDoc.

Advantages::
* The toolchain of choice for a large number of open source projects.
** Easy to find community support, resources and examples.

* Supports multiple output formats, including HTML, HTML single, PDF, ePub, Texinfo, man pages, etc.
* Fully customized document hierarchy, design themes, etc.
* More features can be added with custom extensions.
* Supported by popular community hosting services, such as https://readthedocs.org/[Read the Docs].

Challenges::
* Does not provide native integration with AsciiDoc-based toolchains.
** Extensions or converters must be used to build or convert RST to AsciiDoc. For details, see xref:ccg-asciidoc-converter[].
