# Community Collaboration Guide

This guide has been provided by Red Hat to assist enterprise projects in
collaborating with upstream communities on documentation. For Red Hat, this
guide provides tips for evaluating a community to see if they are prepared for
collaboration with an enterprise software team, communication guidelines,
information about supported and unsupported tools, and guidelines for
structuring git repositories.

In addition to recommendations for Red Hat documentation teams, this guide
provides best practices, templates, and content recommendations to upstream
communities. These suggestions inform communities on how to prepare for Red
Hat writers to collaborate on documentation.

The guide is published at
